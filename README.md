# TechMeet-3rdFeb-2018
This here will contain few of the code material used in the AI/ML meetup. 

## DBSCAN
## kMeans
## ImageProcessing using basics of Tensorflow
  - Everything is similar to the tensorflow repo, except few functions. 
  - Due to large size of two models, they were not committed. a) ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz b) faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz
  - Users are supposed to download these two models from the actual tensorflow github repo and place them in 'ImageProcessing/TechMeetDemo/detection_model_zoo/detection_model_zoo/' folder.
  - The jupyter notebook which is committed was running on the python 3.6 kernel.
  - Out of many use-case of image processing discussed during the talk, only one of the areas is covered: Object Detection.
  - If time permits, I will add a few more use-cases for Image processing.
